{"desc":"1. Hello. Today's video is about how to make a GIF animation from a sequence of images.\n2. Let's start with the creation of the project, of course. Let's limit it to 3 seconds and set the canvas size according to the size of our images.\n3. Upload the images to the resource library.\n4. Create layers for each image.\n5. Assign each layer an image from the library.\n6. To achieve consistent display of images, we will assign them the time of their display.\n7. In total, we have 180 frames for 16 images, respectively, each layer we will display 11 frames.\n8. Let's customize our animation a bit, add the Charlottie logo at the end.\n9. Now everything is ready and you can export."}
